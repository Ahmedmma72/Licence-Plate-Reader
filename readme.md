# License plate Recognition
License plate Recognition (LPR) is the capacity to capture images from license plates and transform the optical data into digital information in real-time. LPR is an important technology that is widely used for vehicle management operations such as illegal parking, stolen vehicles detection and many other applications.
By capturing the license plate digital information, LPR allows operators to immediately gather and associate more data about every vehicle. For example, data about the vehicle like origin, restrictions or security alert and data about the driver like license number, personal public or contact information.
The data capture will be performed using OCR routines to translate characters in an image into digital characters that are machine readable.

## Usage
1. Create a conda environment

```bash
 conda env update -n my_env --file environment.yaml
```

2. Run the app
```bash
python main.py
```
